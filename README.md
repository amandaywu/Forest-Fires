Portugal Forest Fires Analysis

Forest fires have become a much more severe problem in many regions of the world as
a result of climate change and human activities. They not only affect large areas and
people who live nearby, every year, forest fires also release over 3000 million tones of
CO2 into atmosphere, contributing to the acceleration of global greenhouse gas
emissions.

Thus, it is crucial for us to develop an effective fire prediction model from the data we
currently have. Specifically, in this report I will explore the Forest fire data from the
Montesinho Natural Park in the Northeast region of Portugal.
I hope to characterize the current fire regime, understand unobserved patterns in areas
burned, and analyze factors that may explain the forest fires to help the government as
well as the fire department to answer the following questions:
1. What are the variables that influence the total burned area in forest fires?
2. What is a good predictive equation for predicting the total burned area in terms
of given variables?
